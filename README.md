# Ink and Incantation
## The Enchanters Book awaits....
Dive into this new world taking place in the pages of a book, battling the Enchanter, Madman and the Monarch
### Enchanter
Your first opponent <br>
His quick thinking makes him a Formidable Foe, by far the smartest although he only serves to teach<br>
The hand that guides is the first to leave
### Monarch
Your second opponent<br>
She lives to serve her people, only attacking when provoked, she sees the book as a game, without understanding the consequences<br>
failure to entertain will only result in your death
### Madman
Your Final opponent<br>
Locked away for years, he hears the world around him tick, like a clock.<br>
The veil breaks
